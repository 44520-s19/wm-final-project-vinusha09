# Web Mining Final Project
## Twitter Analysis
### Question
##### Retrieving users with highest number of followers, also comparing whether the top users have more number of tweets
### Introduction
#### I used socialblade website to scrap the data and retrieved top 25 users and also visualized the data.
### Libraries Required
##### 1. BeautifulSoup
##### 2. Pandas
##### 3. Requests
##### 4. Matplotlib
##### 5. Seaborn
##### 6. Pickle
### Procedure
##### 1. Web Scraping https://socialblade.com/twitter/ by sending html requests.
##### 2. Pickling and Loading data.
##### 3. Finding rating in each location
##### 4. Loading the data into a table using pandas.
##### 5. Visualizing the results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
### Conclusion
##### In this project I wanted to show top users on twitter with the highest followers.
##### After doing the scrapping  on twitter we could determine the number of followers for top 25 users and their total number of tweets on twitter. 
##### The first graph represents the top 25 users and there respective followers.
##### Hence from the graph I conclude that users with highest number followers may or may not be actively tweeting, because the highest followers have moderately less tweets.
